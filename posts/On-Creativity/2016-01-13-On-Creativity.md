title: On Creating Something Real

I recently submitted my first app to the Pebble smartwatch app store.  This is the first time I've made something that other people can use and download.  I've made a lot of smaller projects before, but nothing that was polished enough that I felt others should use it.  

About a year ago I made a goal to make larger projects, projects that people would actually want to use.  I've made a lot of "toy projects", small projects that I used to teach me a technology.  I wanted to get away from this habit, I want to make things that I'm proud of and I want to use.  Clicking the button to submit my app was a weird feeling.  I was putting my work out there for everyone to read and criticize.  

It's empowering creating something for other's to use.  It feels like you've contributed to other's lives.
