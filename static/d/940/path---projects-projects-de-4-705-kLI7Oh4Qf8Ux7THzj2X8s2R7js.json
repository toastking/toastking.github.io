I was part of their first class in Universities.  Fudge is a recipe storing app that allows users to create collections of recipes and store them in the cloud.  We used Parse to make the backend.  </p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://github.com/NazimAmin/PennAppsIOTPillBox\">PillStacks</a> - PennApps Winter 2015</h1>\n<p><span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 71.07913669064749%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"A picture of the PillStacks device\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/f68751f5a2cf41f7621e980151f300ec/a0e8f/pillstacks.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f68751f5a2cf41f7621e980151f300ec/ff7bd/pillstacks.png 148w,\n/static/f68751f5a2cf41f7621e980151f300ec/a5bd4/pillstacks.png 295w,\n/static/f68751f5a2cf41f7621e980151f300ec/a0e8f/pillstacks.png 590w,\n/static/f68751f5a2cf41f7621e980151f300ec/02b76/pillstacks.png 695w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </span></p>\n<p>Over winter break I attended <a href=\"http://2015s.pennapps.com/\">PennApps Winter 2015</a> with <a href=\"https://github.com/NazimAmin\">one of my friends from Stony Brook</a>.  He had previous experience using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Galileo\">Intel Galileo</a> development board and he wanted to make something with Intel's new board, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Edison\">Edision</a>.  We came up with the idea of an Internet Of Things style pillbox after discussing the difficulties some of our family members' had ensuring their loved ones were taking their medications.  </p>\n<p>The idea was to make a pillbox that could tell what day it was (using the Edison) and then tell the user which box to take pills from.  It would also check if the pills for the day were taken and send that data to a web app.  The web app was made by our two other <a href=\"https://github.com/airrick213\">amazing</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/avarun42\">teammates</a>.  The web app would display if the user had taken the pills in the box or not.  </p>\n<p>We used LED's and photoresistors as sensors to see if the pills were in the box or not.  This lead to an interesting issue, we needed to ensure the box was completely opaque so no light would get in and change our sensor values.  After a late night trip to the CVS near the UPenn campus we decided to use white out and Sharpie's to \"paint\" our pill box.  The advantage of using a photoresistor was the versatility of the sensor.  We could tell by the value of the sensor if the compartment was open or not.  From there we could decide whether to turn the light for the compartment on or off if the compartment was for the current day.  This allowed us to light up the pill compartment for the current day so it's easier for the user to tell which day's pills to take.  </p>\n<p>Our project ended up winning an <em>Honorable Mention in the Health Category</em>!
