Clouds filled the sky and blocked the sun and there a slight drizzle, just enough to be annoying. The Stony Brook Computing Society waited at the train station for the bus to arrive to take us to Maryland. It was supposed to arrive at 1pm, at around 1:30pm the bus driver called and told us he was lost on the LIE. After another hour of directions delivered via phone calls, the buses arrived at Stony Brook. To make this situation funnier some of us had convinced our professor to hold a quiz early…"}},{"node":{"id":"197fc4f1-41e8-5c69-b5f8-92bade7271d3","frontmatter":{"title":"Asynchronous Communication","date":"February 15, 2015"},"fields":{"slug":"/Asynchronous-Communication/2015-02-15-Asynchronous-Communication/"},"excerpt":"Texting, Email, Facebook messages, Tweets, all of our communication is asynchronous, like passing someone a note and hoping they pass it back. There's a reason texting took off so rapidly as the  main form of communication .  It's discrete, you can text during a meeting or in a class much easier than taking a phone call.  Texting also feeds into the desire for immediacy that people crave.  A text is sent quickly and answered quickly.  Seeing the little speech bubble showing the other person typing gives us satisfaction-\"any minute know I'll have my answer\".  While texting is usually immediate…"}},{"node":{"id":"87818dac-02d8-5e77-aa04-44f2a6c4092c","frontmatter":{"title":"SBCS Flask Tutorial","date":"February 25, 2016"},"fields":{"slug":"/Flask-tutorial/2016-02-25-Flask-Tutorial/"},"excerpt":"SBCS Web Tutorial  In this tutorial we will be making a rotating photo gallery, similar to a digital picture frame.  We will be using the Flask framework, Python, jQuery, Bootstrap, and hosting our app on Microsoft's Azure cloud service.    Let's start at the beginning.

I think it's safe to say McHacks wasn't lying when they said they were Canada's \"everything\" Hackathon (though I hear Hack the North is pretty great too!).  There was a ton of great sponsors, homemade cookies, awesome stickers, and incredibly tasty poutine.  It was also just interesting to be in Montreal.  I had never been in another country until McHacks, and it was totally worth the six hour drive through the Great White North of upstate New York. I attempted to make a web app with one of my friends.  It was really the first time I had tried any serious backend work…"}},{"node":{"id":"dc140f58-80c5-502d-9f24-7a53c67f7a76","frontmatter":{"title":"On Creating Something Real","date":"January 13, 2016"},"fields":{"slug":"/On-Creativity/2016-01-13-On-Creativity/"},"excerpt":"I recently submitted my first app to the Pebble smartwatch app store.  This is the first time I've made something that other people can use and download.  I've made a lot of smaller projects before, but nothing that was polished enough that I felt others should use it.   About a year ago I made a goal to make larger projects, projects that people would actually want to use.  I've made a lot of \"toy projects\", small projects that I used to teach me a technology.  I wanted to get away from this habit, I want to make things that I'm proud of and I want to use.
